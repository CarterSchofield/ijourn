# IJourn

## Description

IJourn is a project that I developed to give myself and others a quick and easy way to journal. Expressive writing through journaling can be a powerful way to process stress, trauma, or any other emotion. However, traditional journaling can sometimes be difficult, hence the existence of IJourn.
